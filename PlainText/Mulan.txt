EXT. THE GREAT WALL -NIGHT (SEQUENCE 1.0) 
A MASSIVE, magnificent stone barrier snakes along the mountain tops of China. A lone GUARD patrols it. All's quiet, til ... 
WHOOSH! A falcon swoops over him, knocking off his helmet. It flies upward, RIPPING the Imperial flag from a pole; the crescent moon shines. The guard follows as the bird drops the flag. It flutters over the wall, revealing 
A DARK, OMINOUS MAN in SHADOW, clinging to the side. He GRABS the Guard before he can scream -LIFTING him into the air as 
HUNDREDS of grappling hooks clamp onto the wall. 
IN THE GARRISON 
Startled guards look up as the shadowy MAN enters their sanctuary. As he RAISES his distinctive, curved sword...

The dog pants excitedly. Mulan picks up a bag of grain. 
MULAN Ready to do my chores? 
Tying the bag to his tail and a chicken leg over his head, she opens the door .. 
As the dog chases the chicken leg into the yard, the grain bag breaks, sending the chickens into a feeding frenzy. 
Mulan watches --it'll do --and quickly starts to gather teacups.

MULAN How do you always do that? 
Fa Zhou smiles and CHUCKLES, then stops the tray from spinning. 
FA ZHOU As much as I enjoy this ... these games must soon end. 
(then; warmly) The time has come for you to carry on the family honor.

GRANDMOTHER FA Yep! You're a lucky one! 
The cricket faints. FA LI, Mulan's mother, joins her. 
FA LI (worried) Where's Mulan? 
She points to a group of elegantly dressed girls.

The Chinese characters on a great stone bei GLOW hot red. Moments later, A GHOST materializes on top of the bei. This is THE GHOST OF THE FIRST ANCESTOR. 
He peers at the little dragon incense burner and speaks with a deep, imposing voice that echoes through the temple. 
FIRST ANCESTOR Mushu. . . awaken ! 
Close on the dragon incense burner -trembling as his metal body transforms into a live dragon, and CRASHES to the ground. This is Mushu, a mini-sized dragon with a deep drive to prove he's as good as any guardian. What he lacks in magical powers, he makes up in charm. He rises out of the incense smoke. 
MUSffiJ 
{powerfully} I live! (then} So tell me what mortal needs my 
protection, Great Ancestor. the word and I'm there! 
FIRST ANCESTOR Mushu ... 
MUSHU

The room fills with THE GHOSTS OF THE FA ANCESTORS rising from the tablets lining both sides of the temple. 
ANCESTOR 2 (FEMALE) I knew it! I knew it! That Mulan was a troublemaker from the start. 
ANCESTOR 3 (MALE) Don't look at me -she gets it from your side of the family.

An imposing male ancestor points to the row of stone animals.

The ancestors burst into derisive laughter. 
MUSHU You all don't think I can do it? Watch this here. 
He blows a tiny little flame from his mouth. 
MUSHU OWW! Jump back --I'm pretty hot, huh? 
FIRST ANCESTOR 
(admonishing) You had your chance to protect the Fa family. 
ANCESTOR 8 (FEMALE) Your misguidance led Fa Deng to disaster. 
FA DENG, an ancestor holding his head in his hands, glares at Mushu. 
FA DENG (MALE) Yeah, thanks a lot.

The First Ancestor appears beside Mushu, floating in mid-air.

A GONG FLIES through the air, hitting Mushu in the face. The First Ancestor rubs his temple and sighs.

Mushu starts down to the Great Stone Dragon. 
MUSHU

Mushu walks up to the enormous Stone Dragon perched on a crumbling pedestal and starts BANGING his gong. 
MUSHU Yo, Rocky! Wake up! You've got to go fetch Mulan!

Mushu throws his mallet over his shoulder and starts to climb the Dragon.

No response. Mushu hits the Dragon's ear with his gong. 
MUSHU Hello. . . hellooo! ! ! (off huge whack) Hello!!!

Mushu freezes, then sees 
The First Ancestor, at the window of the family temple. 
FIRST ANCESTOR Have you awakened? 
A beat before the head of the Great Stone Dragon pops up from the bushes. Mushu struggles to hold it steady. Then, he lowers his voice and assumes a persona, a la the Great and Powerful Oz. He waggles the stone face as he speaks. 
MUSHU 
(god-like) I, ah, I ah, yes I just woke up! I am the Great Stone Dragon. Good morning! I will go forth and fetch Mulan! ...Did I mention that I was the Great Stone Dragon? 
FIRST ANCESTOR Go! The fate of the Fa family rests in your claws! 
MUSHU 
(as the Great Stone Dragon) Don' t even worry about it! I will not lose face! 
He loses his grasp on the face. It rolls down the hill, Mushu still holding on. 
MUSHU (falling) Ahhh oww, oh ohh owwww...

Mulan gasps as the men laugh at her underwear necklace. 
SHANG O.S. Soldiers! 
The men stand at attention as Shang enters.

SHANG

Yao bows, then approaches the pole. 
YAO 
(mumbling) Oh, I'll get that arrow, Pretty Boy--and I'll do it with my shirt Qil. 
Shang holds up his hand. 
SHANG One moment. You seem to be missing something. 
Shang opens a box and takes out an elaborately carved disc of stone. He holds up Yao's wrist and ties the disc to it with a colorful silk ribbon. 
SHANG (re: the disc) This --represents discipline. (tying on another disc) And this, represents strength. 
Yao falls to the ground under the weight of the stones. 
SHANG You need both to reach the arrow. 
Yao looks at the top of the pole, then aggressively begins his climb. Grunting, sweating--he starts to make it up, but the weights are too much. He CRASHES to the ground. Chien Po, Ling and Mulan attempt the same and fail. Mulan slowly walks past Shang. 
SHANG We"ve got a long way to go.

Mulan turns to leave when she spies the arrow atop the pole. Determined, she starts to climb the pole. She falls, then gets an idea. Tying the stone discs together, she uses them to pull herself up the pole. The men come to watch, admire, and be motivated by her.

He opens it, revealing a LITTLE DOLL. A beat before the falcon alights on his shoulder. 
Shan-Yu studies the doll, then brings it in close... SNIFFING it. His eyes go wide, and he quickly JUMPS down from tree to tree --landing in front of his MEN. 
They see the doll in his hand.

Then he sees where they're heading--the EDGE OF THE CLIFF. 
MUSHU * We're gonna die we"re gonna die! No way can we survive this. Death is coming! *

Shan-Yu SMASHES through the roof, JUMPING in front of her. She's trapped. She searches for a weapon but only finds a fan. She pulls it out, opens it. Fearfully, she watches Shan-Yu approach. SHAN-YU (smiling) 
It looks like you're out of ideas. SHAN-YU stabs his sword through the fan. SLOW-MOTION as it rips through the painted pieces of silk.

Shan-Yu LUNGES at Mulan. She avoids the blow and uses the sword as a vault to deliver a kick to Shan-Yu's chin. She 
falls to the roof and sweeps her feet, knocking Shan-Yu's

MUSHU and CRI-KEE drop from the sky .. Mushu looks at the black smoke streaming from the right wing of the Imperial Palace, completely decimated. 
MUSHU

EMPEROR And this ...

Mulan holds it reverantly, then throws her arms around the Emperor. The Emperor reacts, pleasantly surprised. 
YAO (whispering; to Ling) Is she allowed to do that? 
Mulan turns to the Gang of Three and hugs each of them. Ling sneaks to the end of the line, receiving another hug. 
YAO (to Ling; upset) Hey, you got two! 
As they start to fight, Chien Po grabs Yao. 
CHIEN PO Yao, relax and chant with me. 
YAO (GROWLING) 
Mulan turns to Shang --they awkwardly regard each other. Mulan looks at him in anticipation. 
SHANG ... Um... you' re a--(shaking her hand) --you fight good.
